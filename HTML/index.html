        <p> Hi, my name is Parisa Kalra (Pari). I live in Bangkok, Thailand. I'm 13 years old and I'm in grade 8.</p>
        <p> My final exams for term 1 is coming up. Wish me luck!</p>
        <p> Today, I went to school and my arm & leg hurts from yesterday's performing arts and carrying my nephew. Today I also had perfroming arts again and we finished another song.</p>
        <p> After lunch, I was called to go to the music room to piano for the event coming up in school. I was asked to play the song Que Sera Sera. I came back home to practice it and I need to know te full song by the 5th of September.</p>
        <p> After that, I went up to my BORING Thai class which we just sat there and listen to the teacher talk for an hour. I was secretly using my Ipad!</p>
        <p> Next, I had MATH... The most boring subject on Earth. NO OFFENCE but it's just a no from me.</p>
        <p> We ended the day with Grammar class. Now, it sue sound boring but we only did work for 10 mins and had free time till we went home. How awesome is that?</p>
        <p> Then, I came back home. My mom & my brother came to pick me up from school. When I reached home, I quickly went up to shower and came down to eat Paneer Roti. It waas yummy!</p>
        <p> After that, I went to bake a cake for my mom's birthday and it's probably cooling right now.</p>
        <p> Then, I practiced piano and now I have my coding class!</p>
